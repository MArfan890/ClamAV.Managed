Getting Started
---------------

To use ClamAV.Managed, P/Invoke must be able to locate clamav.dll, either in
your binary's execution directory or at some location in your system PATH.

You can obtain ClamAV binaries compiled for Windows at
http://oss.netfarm.it/clamav/. At the moment, only the Win32 version is
supported, but the Win64 version may work.

ClamAV.Managed should also work under Mono, although this is not yet a
supported configuration.

Notice
------

While the public version of this library is still in early development, the
type names and class interfaces are subject to change.
